## Surfs Up Module 9 Challenge

## Overview
This weather analysis was done in order to provide data to an investors interested in opening Shake and Surf, as ice cream and surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii. Using weather data from an SQLite database, we coded in Juptyer notebook to see precipitation data trends in Oahu. We imported dependencies for sqlalchemy, matplotlib, datetime, pandas, and numpy. With the precipitation data found to be acceptable, our investor now would like data on temperatures throughout the year, specifically June and Dececmber. We have used the same tools to find temperature trends for Oahu, Hawaii during June and December.
